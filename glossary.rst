   API
      Application Program Interface: A defined set of routines and protocols for
      building application software.

   ACPI
      Advanced Configuration and Power Interface

   BIOS
      Basic Input/Output System.

   GPU
      Graphics Processing Unit

   I2C
      Inter-Integrated Circuit

   IC
      Instrument Cluster

   IVE
      In-Vehicle Experience

   IVI
      In-vehicle Infotainment

   OS
      Operating System

   OSPM
      Operating System Power Management

   PCI
      Peripheral Component Interface.

   PM
      Power Management

   Pass-Through Devices
      Physical devices (typically PCI) exclusively assigned to a guest.  In
      the Project ACRN architecture, pass-through devices are owned by the
      foreground OS.

   PV
      Para-virtualization (See
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paravirtualization)

   RSE
      Rear Seat Entertainment

   SDC
      Software Defined Cockpit

   SOS
      Service OS

   UEFI
      Unified Extensible Firmare Interface. UEFI replaces the
      traditional BIOS on PCs, while also providing BIOS emulation for
      backward compatibility. UEFI can run in 32-bit or 64-bit mode and, more
      important, support Secure Boot, checking the OS validity to ensure no
      malware has tampered with the boot process.

   UOS
      User OS (also known as Guest OS)

   VHM
      Virtio and Hypervisor Service Module

   VM
      Virtual Machine

   VMM
      Virtual Machine Monitor

   VMX
      Virtual Machine Extension

   Virtio-BE
      Back-End, VirtIO framework provides front-end driver and back-end driver
      for IO mediators, developer has habit of using Shorthand. So they say
      Virtio-BE and Virtio-FE

   Virtio-FE

   VT
      Intel Virtualization Technology

   VT-d
      Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O

   IDT
      Interrupt Descriptor Table: a data structure used by the x86
      architecture to implement an interrupt vector table. The IDT is used
      to determine the correct response to interrupts and exceptions.

   ISR
      Interrupt Service Routine: Also known as an interrupt handler, an ISR
      is a callback function whose execution is triggered by a hardware
      interrupt (or software interrupt instructions) and is used to handle
      high-priority conditions that require interrupting the current code
      executing on the processor.
